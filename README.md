# project-1
Sleep Study by Rebekah Higley and John Weissmann

We each worked on a section of the data that we retreieved from Kaggle, John worked on main.ipynb and Rebekah worked on main2.ipynb. John then combined the two based on the questions we set out to answer and that is what populates the presentation.ipynb file. Rebekah completed the final analysis document. The Project 1 Sleep file is an overview of our brainstorming process at the beginning of the project work cycle.
